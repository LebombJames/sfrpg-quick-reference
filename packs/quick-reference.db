{"_id":"0VwolXKB37rmUQzm","name":"Combat Maneuvers","content":"<p>As a standard action, you can attempt one of the following combat maneuvers. For each maneuver, choose an opponent within your reach (including your weapon’s reach, if applicable) and then make a melee attack roll against the opponent’s KAC + 8. The effects of success vary depending on the maneuver, as described below.</p>\n<h1>Bull Rush</h1>\n<p>You knock the target back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8. If an obstacle is in the way, the target stops at the obstacle instead.</p>\n<h1>Dirty Trick</h1>\n<p>You make an unorthodox attack to briefly hinder the target. A dirty trick could be throwing sand in the target’s eyes, jamming a rock into his actuators, or any other improvised action designed to put your opponent at a disadvantage. Your target is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{Deafened}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened} (your choice) for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8 (see Conditions beginning on page 273 for information on these conditions). The target can remove the condition as a move action. A dirty trick is normally a melee attack, but a GM can allow certain actions to count as dirty tricks at range, in which case you take a –2 penalty to your attack roll for every 5 feet between you and the target.</p>\n<h1>Disarm</h1>\n<p>You knock an item the target is holding out of the target’s hands and onto the ground. If you have a hand free, you can automatically grab the item with your hand before it falls.</p>\n<h1>Grapple</h1>\n<p>You hold the target in place. You must have at least one hand free to perform a grapple combat maneuver. Your target has the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} condition, meaning she can’t move from her current space and takes further penalties until she either uses a standard action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver to grapple you (giving you the grappled condition) or uses the escape task of the @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.VPGrhncTMiLzpYCH]{Acrobatics} skill to break free. If the result of your attack roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 13, the target is instead @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XgK4EdO5D3Fj3iWz]{Pinned} for the same duration, and she can’t take any actions that involve moving her limbs other than to attempt to escape.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The grappled or pinned condition lasts until the end of your next turn, unless you renew it on your next turn with another grapple combat maneuver. The condition ends immediately if you move away. As long as you have one target grappled or pinned, you cannot attempt to grapple another. The grappled and pinned conditions are further detailed in Conditions on pages 276–277.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When you renew a grapple, you can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed, including most weapons and equipment (but not worn armor). Doing so immediately ends the grapple.</p>\n<h1>Reposition</h1>\n<p>You change the target’s position to a different location still within your reach and within 5 feet of its original placement. You can move the target 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8, but all movement must remain within your reach. You cannot move the target past an obstacle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you reposition a creature as a full action, you can move a distance equal to the distance you repositioned your target (up to your move speed), dragging the target along with you.</p>\n<h1>Sunder</h1>\n<p>You deal damage to one object held in the target’s hand or accessible on its body. The object must be something that could be drawn easily by the target as a move action (see @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.MZQAv36DPh5AuI73]{Draw or Sheathe a Weapon} on page 247). The damage is reduced by an amount equal to the object’s hardness (see Smashing an Object page 409).</p>\n<h1>Trip</h1>\n<p>You knock the target prone if it is on the ground. A target in the air instead descends 10 feet, falling @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} if this causes it to fall to the ground. A target in zero gravity is instead knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.QnGpBSHSTiszjPSb]{Off-Kilter}.

At any time, if you doubt something another creature is telling you, you can request the GM to allow you to attempt a Sense Motive check to determine whether it is deceiving you. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter; otherwise, it’s a move action. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by that creature’s Bluff check. If you succeed, you realize that you are being deceived or that a lie is being told, but not how it is untrue, nor does it let you know the truth. If you fail (or if no deception or lie is being made), you believe that the speaker doesn’t seem to be deceiving you. Failing the check by 5 or more may mean (at the GM’s discretion) you believe that a truthful statement contains deceptions or that a lie or deception is a truthful statement.</p>\n<h1>Discern Secret Message</h1>\n<p>If you overhear or otherwise intercept a secret message, you can use Sense Motive to learn the gist of its true meaning. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by a Bluff check attempted by the creature passing the secret message. If you succeed, you learn the information contained in the secret message. If you fail (or if there is no secret message), you don’t detect any hidden meaning in the message. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you might infer false information, as determined by the GM. Often, the GM rolls these checks in secret and informs you of the results.</p>\n<h1>Sense Mental Effect</h1>\n<p>You can use Sense Motive to ascertain whether another creature within 30 feet is affected by a mental effect, even if the creature is unaware of the effect. You must spend at least 1 minute interacting with the creature. The DC of this check is typically 25, but it can be higher or lower based on how overt the manifestation of the mental effect is, as determined by the GM.

Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5.</p>\n<h1>Missing with a Thrown Weapon</h1>\n<p>If you miss on a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, the weapon lands in a random square or grid intersection as appropriate near your target. To determine where it lands, roll 1d8. This determines the initial misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction, as illustrated in the diagram above. After you’ve determined the misdirection of the throw, roll 1d4. The result is how many squares away in that direction the weapon lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For example, after a missed ranged attack with a grenade, a player rolls 1d8 with a result of 1. This indicates that the grenade’s initial misdirection falls short of the target intersection. Then, the player rolls 1d4 with a result of 2. This determines that the grenade actually lands at an intersection 2 squares in front of the target intersection.</p>\n<h1>Range and Penalties</h1>\n<p>A ranged weapon’s range increment is listed along with its other statistics (see Chapter 7). If you make an attack with a ranged weapon from a distance greater than its listed range, you take a cumulative –2 penalty to the attack roll for each full range increment of distance between you and the target beyond the first (or fraction thereof).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For most ranged weapons, the maximum range is 10 range increments, or 10× the number listed as the weapon’s range. For thrown weapons, the maximum range is 5 range increments. Some ranged weapons have different maximum ranges, but if so, their descriptions specify their maximum ranges.</p>\n<h1>Critical Hits</h1>\n<p>When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20), you hit regardless of your target’s AC. If the total result of your attack roll meets or exceeds the target’s EAC or KAC (as appropriate for your attack), you’ve also scored a critical hit. You roll your damage twice, each time with all your usual bonuses and including any additional damage from special abilities, and then add the rolls together. Some weapons inflict a special effect on a target of a critical hit, in addition to dealing double damage (see page 182).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the total result of your attack is less than your target’s relevant AC, your attack still hits on a natural 20, but it deals damage normally.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_yugunn264m","path":"Quick Reference#/CF_SEP/Combat#/CF_SEP/Standard Actions","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.db.79DPmTtS7WLyfsUj"}}}

The amount of time this takes depends on the complexity of the device but typically requires at least one full action. The DC of the check is determined by the GM and is based on the complexity of the device. For extremely complex devices or systems, the GM might require multiple checks. The GM rolls the Engineering check to disable a device in secret, so you don’t necessarily know whether your attempt has succeeded or failed. If you succeed, you disable the device. If you fail the check and discover your error, you can attempt to disable the device again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is an explosive or a trap, you trigger it. If you are attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can also use the disable device task to rig a device to work normally for a while, and then become disabled sometime later. This increases the DC of the check by 5. If you want to leave no trace of your tampering, the DC increases by an additional 5. If you succeed at the check, you can rig the device to become disabled up to 1 round later for each rank of Engineering you have. If you fail the check by 5 or more, your efforts have the same effect as if you were merely attempting to disable the device.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Due to the danger, you cannot take 20 on an Engineering check to disable a device.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DC for an Engineering check to disable a device is based on the complexity of the device.

The attacker ignores the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his target is.</p>\n<h1>Soft Cover</h1>\n<p>Creatures, even enemies, between you and the source of an effect provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, soft cover provides no bonus to Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to attempt a Stealth check.</p>\n<h1>Partial Cover</h1>\n<p>If more than half of you is visible, your bonuses from cover are reduced to +2 to AC and +1 to Reflex saving throws.</p>\n<h1>Improved Cover</h1>\n<p>In some cases, such as when a target is hiding behind a gun port in a defensive wall, cover provides greater bonuses to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal bonuses to AC and Reflex saves are doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively).</p>\n<h1>Total Cover</h1>\n<p>If an enemy doesn’t have line of effect to you (see page 271), you have total cover from the enemy.

If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude saving throws against severe weather while moving up to half your overland speed, or a +4 bonus if you remain stationary and build a temporary shelter. You can grant this bonus to one other creature for every 1 point by which your result exceeds the DC. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to endure severe weather.</p>\n<h1>Follow Tracks</h1>\n<p>You can use Survival to either find tracks or follow tracks you have found for 1 mile or until they become difficult to follow, whichever occurs first. Finding tracks requires a full action. If you move at half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Survival check. You can move at your full speed with a –5 penalty to the check or at twice your normal speed with a –20 penalty to the check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The base DCs for Survival checks to follow tracks depend on the surface and are adjusted based on prevailing conditions and the group being tracked; such modifiers are cumulative.

This functions just like a Diplomacy check to change a person’s initial attitude, but it is not language-dependent. A typical domesticated animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<h1>Live Off the Land</h1>\n<p>You can use Survival to keep yourself and others fed in the wild by hunting and foraging, enabling you to move up to half your overland speed without needing food and water supplies. Typically, one check determines the success of your efforts for a single day. You can provide food and water for one other character for every 2 points by which the result of your check exceeds 10. In some cases, an environment may be so inhospitable (such as an airless asteroid) that it is impossible to live off the land. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to live off the land.</p>\n<h1>Orienteering</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>Once each hour while traveling through unfamiliar terrain and each time you move close to a natural hazard such as quicksand or patches of poisonous atmosphere, you can use Survival to keep from getting lost or to notice or avoid the hazard.</p>\n<h1>Predict Weather</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>You can use Survival to predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. You must spend at least 1 minute observing the surrounding area and its current weather patterns. You can predict the weather an additional day in advance for every 5 points by which your result exceeds 15. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to predict weather.</p>\n<h1>Rear a Wild Animal (Trained Only)</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>You can use Survival to raise a wild animal from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to use this task to rear wild creatures other than animals. Rearing a wild animal typically takes months or even years. If you succeed at the check at the end of this time, the animal is domesticated and has an initial attitude of friendly toward you. You can rear as many as three animals of the same kind at one time.</p>\n<h1>Ride a Creature</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>You can use Survival to ride an animal or another beast as a mount. The most typical actions while riding a creature don’t require checks. As a move action, you can either mount, ride (using the mount’s speed instead of yours), or dismount from a creature; you must use one hand to ride a creature. Saddling a creature typically takes at least 1 minute, but the process could take longer if you’re using an unusual saddle or mount.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following actions do require Survival checks and can be performed only while mounted.</p>\n<h2>Control Mount in Battle</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>You can attempt to control a mount not normally trained for combat while in battle. This is part of whatever action you are attempting to have the mount accomplish. If you fail the check, you lose that action.</p>\n<h2>Cover</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As a swift action, you can drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail the check, you don’t gain the benefit of cover, and you can’t attack or cast until you pull yourself back up. In either case, pulling yourself back up takes a move action and doesn’t require a check.</p>\n<h2>Fast Mount or Dismount</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>You can attempt to mount or dismount from a creature as a swift action instead of a move action.</p>\n<h2>Fight from a Combat-Trained Mount</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>Each round you direct a mount trained for combat into battle, you must attempt a Survival check to ride as a swift action. If you succeed at the check, you can still make your own attacks as normal, along with any attacks the mount can make. If you fail the check, either you or your mount can make attacks, but not both.</p>\n<h2>Guide with Knees</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As part of a move action to ride, you can guide your mount with your knees, keeping your hands free. If you fail the check, you must still use one hand to guide your mount, dropping an item or changing grip if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Leap</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As part of a move action to ride, you can guide your mount to leap over an obstacle. If you succeed at the check, the mount must still succeed at an Athletics check to jump, but it can use your Survival bonus in place of its Athletics bonus, if that number is greater. If you fail the initial Survival check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage or 1d6 falling damage, whichever is greater.</p>\n<h2>Soft Fall</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As a reaction, you can reduce the damage you take from a fall off your mount (see page 400). With a successful check, you reduce the damage you take from the fall by 1d6.</p>\n<h2>Spur Mount</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As a part of a move action to ride, you can attempt to spur your mount to greater speeds. If you succeed at the check, the mount’s speed increases by 5 feet for that move action, but the mount takes 1d3 damage whether or not the check succeeds or fails. You can use this ability as often as you want, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the mount becomes fatigued. You cannot spur a fatigued mount.</p>\n<h2>Stay Mounted</h2>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>As a reaction, you can try to avoid falling off your mount when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_i4jrly0ugm","path":"Quick Reference#/CF_SEP/Skills","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.db.qTDSZyrQ7duwA0pK"}}}

This is the most basic task of the Perception skill. It can be used for a variety of reasons determined by the GM. You might attempt a Perception check to see if you can act in a surprise round, to spot something important out of the corner of your eye, or to realize there are hidden creatures nearby (though you can’t notice a creature that is invisible unless it makes itself known; see page 264). A Perception check to notice usually does not involve taking an action, though you must be conscious and have the use of at least some of your senses to do so. The GM determines the DC. You cannot take 20 on a Perception check to notice things.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to notice things are determined by the GM based on the circumstances and may be adjusted to reflect other conditions.

Sometimes, if you are being particularly alert for those in the area who might be in disguise, the GM might allow you to do this without taking an action. This check is opposed by a Disguise check attempted by the disguised creature. If you succeed, you realize the creature is disguised and not who it seems, but not necessarily who or what the disguised creature is beneath that disguise.

You can also search an area to find anything of interest that might be hidden or is otherwise not immediately noticeable, such as concealed cargo compartments or hidden treasure. In that case, it takes 1 minute to search an area no more than 20 feet by 20 feet (or smaller, if the GM rules the area is particularly cluttered or complex).

Generally, you need to attempt an Acrobatics check while flying only if you attempt a difficult maneuver or are in dangerous wind conditions. Usually, these checks are attempted as part of a move action while flying. You receive a bonus or penalty to Acrobatics checks to fly depending on your maneuverability: a –8 penalty for clumsy maneuverability, no bonus for average maneuverability, or a +8 bonus for perfect maneuverability.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following situations require Acrobatics checks and have consequences for failure. The DCs for such checks are based on the current wind and air conditions and other factors determined by the GM. You can’t take 20 on Acrobatics checks to fly.</p>\n<h2>Avoid Falling Damage</h2>\n<p>If you are falling and you can fly, you can attempt an Acrobatics check as a reaction to negate the damage from the fall. If you fail, you fall normally. If you have perfect maneuverability, you can avoid falling damage automatically without attempting a check.</p>\n<h2>Fly in Dangerous Wind Conditions</h2>\n<p>The more violent the wind conditions, the more difficult it is to keep flying. In conditions of windstorm or higher (51+ mph; see page 400), you must attempt an Acrobatics check to stay aloft each time you move. If you fail this check, you cannot move. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you are blown 2d6 × 10 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind (or in a direction decided by the GM), and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. You can’t take 10 on Acrobatics checks to fly in dangerous wind conditions.</p>\n<h2>Hover</h2>\n<p>Safe flight typically requires momentum. If you wish to stay in place, or hover, while flying, you must attempt an Acrobatics check as a move action. If you fail, you fall. If you have clumsy maneuverability, you can’t hover at all. If you have average maneuverability and at least 5 ranks in Acrobatics or if you have perfect maneuverability, you can hover automatically without attempting a check; this does not require a move action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Acrobatics checks to fly are based on the prevailing wind conditions. The following chart provides the base DCs for air conditions, whether an Acrobatics check is required to fly in those air conditions, and whether a creature can take 10 on an Acrobatics check to fly. These wind conditions typically represent fairly clear skies and consistent wind speeds. The DC increases by as much as 5 for choppy wind or airborne debris, or 10 for both.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Wind Conditions</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Check Required?</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Take 10?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Light to moderate (0–20 mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">15</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Strong (21–30 mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">17</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Severe (31–50 mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">19</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Windstorm (51–74 mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">27</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Hurricane force (75–174 mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">33</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Tornado force (175+ mph)</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">39</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">Yes</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Tumble</h1>\n<p>As long as you do not have the encumbered or overburdened condition (see pages 275–276), you can use Acrobatics to move through a space threatened by an enemy or enemies without provoking attacks of opportunity from them. Tumbling is a move action, and you move at half speed. The DC to move through an opponent’s threatened area is 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If multiple opponents are threatening the same space, you attempt one check with a DC based on the opponent with the highest CR, and the DC increases by 2 for each additional opponent beyond the first.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can also tumble directly through an opponent’s space; the DC is 20 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If you fail this check, you stop moving adjacent to your opponent and provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you attempt to move through multiple threatened spaces or opponents’ spaces during the same round, you must succeed at a check for each space, and the DC of each check beyond the first increases by 2. For example, if you tumble through a space threatened by two CR 1 creatures and a CR 2 creature, the DC = 15 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 22. If you then tumble through the space of the CR 2 creature, the DC = 20 + 3 + 2 = 25.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In all of these cases, the DC is modified by the same environmental circumstances that apply to the balance task of Acrobatics (see page 135). If you fail the check, you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. If you want to move at full speed while tumbling, you take a –10 penalty to the check. You can use Acrobatics to tumble while prone, but you can move only 5 feet as a full action and take a –5 penalty to the check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use the following base DCs for Acrobatics checks to tumble.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Situation</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC*</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Move through a threatened area</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">15 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Move through an enemy’s space</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">20 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p>* The DC increases by 2 for each additional threatened space or opponent’s space you move through in 1 round.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_i4jrly0ugm","path":"Quick Reference#/CF_SEP/Skills","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.db.rIp1Kgqwqlx9fmNS"}}}

If you don’t have physical access to a computer system’s user interface, you must use a hacking kit to access and manipulate the system. Details of computers themselves begin on page 213.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Computers are set up to give one or more authorized users “root access,” allowing them to access any information or function of the computer as a standard action, with no need for a Computers check. Firewalls can block off specific sections of a computer and grant different users root access to those sections.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The base DC for many of the tasks of the Computers skill is equal to 13 + (4 × the computer’s tier). These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.</p>\n<h1>Access Unsecured System</h1>\n<p>As a standard action, you can use Computers to access an unsecured computer system’s most basic functions. The DC to access the information or functions of a public computer with no countermeasures or firewalls is generally 10. Unlike other tasks of the Computers skill, you can attempt to access a system untrained if you take 20 on the task, requiring 2 minutes. Secured computer systems, and secured sections of an unsecured system, can be accessed by making a Computers check to hack a system.</p>\n<h1>Craft Computer</h1>\n<p>If you have enough ranks in Computers, you can build computers. See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p>\n<h1>Create or Detect Forgery</h1>\n<p>You can use Computers to forge official documents. This takes 1d4 minutes.

This check is opposed by the Computers check of anyone who examines the document to determine its authenticity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Computers checks to detect a forgery are based on the type of forged document as well as other circumstances determined by the GM, as shown in the table below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Circumstance</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Document contradicts knowledge or orders</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Type of document is well known to examiner</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Type of document is unknown to examiner</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Examiner only casually reviews document</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Forger has a sample of a similar document</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Destroy or Repair System or Module</h1>\n<p>You can use Computers to repair a computer system or module that has been disabled, or destroy one that has been either removed or disabled by spending 10 minutes per tier of the computer system working on the computer. The DC is based on the tier of the computer system. If you are repairing a disabled module or system and you fail the check by 5 or more, you accidentally destroy the module or system. You can’t take 20 on a Computers check to destroy or repair a computer system.</p>\n<h1>Detect Fake Shell</h1>\n<p>If you have access to a computer, but not root access, you may actually only have access to a fake shell (see page 217). If you succeed at the check, which takes a full action, you realize that you have accessed a fake shell. The DC is equal to the DC to hack the computer + 5 (see Table 7–22: Computer Tiers on page 214).</p>\n<h1>Disable or Manipulate Module</h1>\n<p>A character with root access to a computer can disable or manipulate a countermeasure or module as a standard action with a DC 10 Computers check. If you have access (but not root access) to a computer, you can attempt a Computers check to activate, add, disable, or manipulate any countermeasure or module. If you want to affect a countermeasure or module that is behind a firewall, you must first hack the system (see below) to gain access to it. Activating or disabling a countermeasure or module generally takes a standard action. Adding or removing a module generally takes 1 minute per tier of the computer. All of these tasks have a DC equal to the DC to hack the system. You cannot take 20 on a Computers check to disable or manipulate a module.</p>\n<h1>Gain Root Access</h1>\n<p>If you have access to a computer, you can attempt to upgrade your authorization to gain root access. This works similar to hacking the same computer, but the DC is 20 higher. In many cases it is impossible to gain root access, and every task beyond the computer’s basic functions must be attempted as a separate check to destroy, repair, disable, or manipulate modules or countermeasures. If a firewall has been set to have a different set of authorized users with root access, you must gain root access to it separately. Once you have root access to a computer, you can alter who else is granted root access with a successful Computers check to hack the system.</p>\n<h1>Hack System</h1>\n<p>You can use Computers to hack a computer system to which you don’t already have access. Hacking a computer system typically takes one full action per tier of the computer system. You can cut this time in half (to a minimum of one full action) for every 5 by which you increase the DC of the Computers check. If you succeed at the check, you gain access to any part of the computer that is not behind a firewall (see page 217). This allows you to use the basic functions of the computer and to make further checks that require you to have access. Accessing parts of a computer behind a firewall requires an additional Computers check for each firewall.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_i4jrly0ugm","path":"Quick Reference#/CF_SEP/Skills","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.db.rfmdaRnvC7PoQiwV"}}}

See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p>\n<h1>Disable Magic Device</h1>\n<p>You can use Mysticism to disable a magical trap or other magical item. This functions as the disable device task of the Engineering skill, and the DC of the check is based on the trap itself. You can’t take 20 on a Mysticism check to disable a magic device.</p>\n<h1>Identify a Spell Being Cast</h1>\n<p>If you can clearly observe a spell being cast, you can use Mysticism to identify the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + 5 × the level of the spell being cast. This does not require an action. You can’t take 10 or 20 on a Mysticism check to identify a spell.</p>\n<h1>Identify Creature</h1>\n<p>You can use Mysticism to identify constructs with the magical subtype, dragons, fey, magical beasts, outsiders, and undead (see page 133).</p>\n<h1>Identify Magic Item</h1>\n<p>As part of the action to cast detect magic, you can use Mysticism to identify the properties and command words of magic and hybrid items. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × the item level. You can usually attempt a Mysticism check to identify a magic item only once per 24-hour period; further attempts within that period fail. However, casting an identify spell allows you to attempt a second check in the same 24-hour period and grants you a +10 insight bonus to the check. If you have the time, you can take 20 to attempt another check to identify a magic item in the same 24-hour period, but only if you can perform research, such as with access to an information network or downloaded data set.</p>\n<h1>@Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.Goqv1PZPJVuHpinx]{Recall Knowledge}</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 144</p>\n<p>You can use Mysticism to recall knowledge about alchemical theory, arcane symbols, deities, magic traditions, the planes, religious traditions and symbols, and related topics (see page 133).</p>\n<h1>Repair Item</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 144</p>\n<p>You can use Mysticism to repair a magical or hybrid piece of equipment, as long you have access to it. This typically takes 1 hour. You can repair a piece of equipment you crafted in half the usual time. The DC of the check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × item level. For a magical object without an item level, the GM determines the DC and the amount of time it takes to repair the object based on the object’s complexity (see the repair item task of the @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.Kt8ETlWr4oTWyebS]{Engineering} skill on page 142 for guidelines). If you succeed, you restore a number of Hit Points equal to the result of your Mysticism check. If you fail the check by 10 or more, you damage the item further, dealing 1d4 damage to it; this damage can’t reduce an item to fewer than 1 HP.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the piece of equipment is damaged but not broken, you can repair it at no cost. If it is broken but not destroyed, you must spend 10 UPBs per item level (see page 233) each time you attempt to repair it.

{"_id":"z1zQfgzdjY6Zi4wm","name":"Diplomacy","content":"<p>You can persuade others to be friendly toward you, resolve conflicts and differences, and learn common knowledge and rumors floating around a settlement.</p>\n<h1>Change Attitude</h1>\n<p>When you interact socially with another creature, that creature has an initial attitude toward you. Attitudes fall into five categories (from worst to best): hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful. You can use Diplomacy to change a creature’s initial attitude to a more positive one, but at the risk of angering the creature and worsening its attitude toward you if you fail. This is a language-dependent ability. The creature must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher, and you must spend at least 1 minute interacting and conversing with the creature to change its attitude. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Diplomacy skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR (or the encounter’s CR, if you are trying to change the attitude of a group of creatures), whichever is higher. The DC is modified by the creature’s initial attitude (see page 140) and other circumstances, as determined by the GM. If you succeed, the creature’s attitude improves by one category (for instance, a hostile creature becomes unfriendly). If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you can choose to spend 10 more minutes interacting with the creature to improve its attitude by one additional category. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you anger the creature, and the creature’s attitude worsens by one category (for instance, a friendly creature becomes indifferent).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attacking a creature always worsens its attitude by one category for each attack made, and may have other consequences based on the creature’s current attitude.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Positively affecting a creature’s attitude takes time. You typically can’t use Diplomacy to positively change a creature’s attitude by more than one category (or two categories if you spend the extra time) within a 24-hour period, unless the GM decides otherwise or you have an ability that allows you to do so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The five categories of initial attitude are described below, along with the effects of negatively changing each attitude.</p>\n<h2>Hostile</h2>\n<p>A hostile creature would rather attack you either physically or verbally, than civilly converse with you. Most enemies you meet are hostile. It’s often hard to talk diplomatically with hostile creatures, though it can be done remotely (via a communication device) or by avoiding combat with the creatures while persuading them to listen to reason. If you fail the Diplomacy check by 5 or more, you can’t attempt to change a hostile creature’s attitude again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Unfriendly</h2>\n<p>Unfriendly creatures are typically wary of you, or afraid you will try to hurt them if they aren’t careful or fail to keep you at bay. Unfriendly creatures become hostile when angered or attacked.</p>\n<h2>Indifferent</h2>\n<p>Indifferent creatures take little notice of you, but hold no ill will against you. They don’t care about your plight, but may give you simple advice or directions. Most creatures you meet in everyday life or in settlements are indifferent. Indifferent creatures become unfriendly when angered or attacked.</p>\n<h2>Friendly</h2>\n<p>Either due to a generally cheerful disposition or a predisposition to like you, friendly creatures treat you with kindness and respect. They may give you more-detailed advice or simple aid, but generally won’t go out of their way to be helpful. If angered or attacked, friendly creatures become indifferent and often try to avoid further contact with you if possible.</p>\n<h2>Helpful</h2>\n<p>Helpful creatures are not only friendly, but desire to help you, within reasonable means. Helpful creatures typically give you more lengthy or difficult aid, or offer small services that are readily available to them. When angered or attacked, helpful creatures become friendly, but somewhat guarded, as they are often confused by such reactions to their generosity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Diplomacy checks to change attitudes are adjusted based on the creature’s initial attitude as well as other circumstances determined by the GM.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Initial Attitude</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Hostile</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Unfriendly</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Indifferent</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Friendly</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Helpful</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">—*</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* You cannot improve a creature’s attitude above helpful.</p>\n<h1>Gather Information</h1>\n<p>Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 140</p>\n<p>You can use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual.

You cannot take 20 on a Perception check to notice things.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to notice things are determined by the GM based on the circumstances and may be adjusted to reflect other conditions. See the search task below for a chart with some example circumstances and their typical DCs.</p>\n<h1>Pierce Disguise</h1>\n<p>As a move action, you can use Perception to recognize that a creature has changed its appearance. Sometimes, if you are being particularly alert for those in the area who might be in disguise, the GM might allow you to do this without taking an action. This check is opposed by a Disguise check attempted by the disguised creature. If you succeed, you realize the creature is disguised and not who it seems, but not necessarily who or what the disguised creature is beneath that disguise. If the disguised creature is impersonating a particular individual that you know, the GM might grant you a bonus to your Perception check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Divination magic or scanners that allow you to see through illusions or holograms do not penetrate mundane and low-tech disguises, but they can negate illusory or holographic components of a disguise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to pierce a disguise are adjusted according to how familiar the observer is with the particular individual the disguised creature is masquerading as, as well as other circumstances determined by the GM.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Intimate</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Close friends</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Friends or associates</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Recognizes on sight</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Search</h1>\n<p>As a move action, you can use Perception to search for something in particular, such as finding an invisible creature that has made itself known or a hidden creature you know is in the area, or looking for nearby traps or hazards. You can also search an area to find anything of interest that might be hidden or is otherwise not immediately noticeable, such as concealed cargo compartments or hidden treasure. In that case, it takes 1 minute to search an area no more than 20 feet by 20 feet (or smaller, if the GM rules the area is particularly cluttered or complex). The DC is determined by the Stealth check of the creature, by the trap or hazard involved, or by the GM. If you are not in combat, you can take 20 on a Perception check to search.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to search may be adjusted by the GM based on the circumstances and to reflect other conditions.

This is the most basic task of the Perception skill. It can be used for a variety of reasons determined by the GM. You might attempt a Perception check to see if you can act in a surprise round, to spot something important out of the corner of your eye, or to realize there are hidden creatures nearby (though you can’t notice a creature that is invisible unless it makes itself known; see page 264). A Perception check to notice usually does not involve taking an action, though you must be conscious and have the use of at least some of your senses to do so. The GM determines the DC. You cannot take 20 on a Perception check to notice things.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to notice things are determined by the GM based on the circumstances and may be adjusted to reflect other conditions. See the search task below for a chart with some example circumstances and their typical DCs.</p>\n<h1>Pierce Disguise</h1>\n<p>As a move action, you can use Perception to recognize that a creature has changed its appearance. Sometimes, if you are being particularly alert for those in the area who might be in disguise, the GM might allow you to do this without taking an action. This check is opposed by a Disguise check attempted by the disguised creature. If you succeed, you realize the creature is disguised and not who it seems, but not necessarily who or what the disguised creature is beneath that disguise. If the disguised creature is impersonating a particular individual that you know, the GM might grant you a bonus to your Perception check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Divination magic or scanners that allow you to see through illusions or holograms do not penetrate mundane and low-tech disguises, but they can negate illusory or holographic components of a disguise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The DCs for Perception checks to pierce a disguise are adjusted according to how familiar the observer is with the particular individual the disguised creature is masquerading as, as well as other circumstances determined by the GM.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-right:1px solid white;border-left:1px solid white;border-top-color:white;border-bottom-color:white;border-image:initial;background-color:#292929;color:#ffffff;font-family:'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;font-size:15px\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top:0px\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\"><strong style=\"margin-top:0px\">DC Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Intimate</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Close friends</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background:#3e3e3e\">\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Friends or associates</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin:0px;border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;text-align:center\">Recognizes on sight</td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid white;padding:1px 5px;margin:0px;text-align:center\">–4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Search</h1>\n<p>As a move action, you can use Perception to search for something in particular, such as finding an invisible creature that has made itself known or a hidden creature you know is in the area, or looking for nearby traps or hazards. You can also search an area to find anything of interest that might be hidden or is otherwise not immediately noticeable, such as concealed cargo compartments or hidden treasure. In that case, it takes 1 minute to search an area no more than 20 feet by 20 feet (or smaller, if the GM rules the area is particularly cluttered or complex). The DC is determined by the Stealth check of the creature, by the trap or hazard involved, or by the GM.

{"_id":"hXOrnZVIneVNZ83o","name":"Medicine","content":"<p>You have knowledge of the biology of many species and can treat a number of different types of wounds and ailments. The DCs of most Medicine tasks are based on the type of equipment used (see Chapter 7 for that information).</p>\n<h1>First Aid</h1>\n<p>As a standard action, you can use Medicine to stop bleed damage or administer first aid to a dying creature that you can touch. The DC of this check is 15. If you succeed at the check, the creature stops dying and becomes stable, or the bleed damage ends. Unlike with other tasks of the Medicine skill, you can attempt the first aid task untrained. You can’t take 20 on a Medicine check to administer first aid.</p>\n<h1>Long-Term Care</h1>\n<p>You can use Medicine to provide long-term care to a living, wounded creature. This can take a day or more, requires a medical lab or a medical bay on a starship, and has a DC of 30. If you succeed at the check, the patient recovers Hit Points and ability score damage (as well as recovers from poison states) at twice the normal rate. If you exceed the DC by 10 or more, the patient recovers Hit Points and ability score damage (as well as recovers from poison states) at three times the normal rate. You can tend as many as six patients at a time, attempting a check for each one each day to determine the rate of healing. You cannot take 20 on a Medicine check to provide long-term care.</p>\n<h1>Long-Term Stability</h1>\n<p>You can use Medicine to tend a creature that is unconscious but stable, ensuring that it doesn’t die while it remains unconscious. Each hour, before the unconscious creature attempts its Constitution check, you can attempt a DC 15 Medicine check. If you succeed, the unconscious creature gains a +2 bonus to its Constitution check and, if its Constitution check result is less than 10, can treat its result as if it were 10. See Long-Term Stability on page 251 for more information.</p>\n<h1>Treat Deadly Wounds</h1>\n<p>You can use Medicine to restore Hit Points to a living, wounded creature. This takes 1 minute, and the DC is based on the medical equipment used. If you succeed at the check, you restore 1 Hit Point per level or CR of the creature you are treating. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you add your Intelligence modifier to the amount healed. A creature can receive this treatment only once every 24-hour period, unless it is delivered in a medical lab. Most medical labs allow you to treat a creature’s deadly wounds at least twice per day.</p>\n<h1>Treat Disease</h1>\n<p>You can use Medicine to treat a creature suffering from a disease. This takes 10 minutes and requires a medkit, a medical lab, or a medical bay on a starship. Every time the diseased creature attempts a saving throw against the disease, you can attempt a Medicine check. If your result exceeds the DC of the disease, the creature receives a +4 bonus to its saving throw against the disease.</p>\n<h1>Treat Drugs or Poison</h1>\n<p>As a standard action, you can use Medicine to treat a drugged or poisoned creature. This requires a medkit, a medical lab, or a medical bay on a starship. Every time the creature attempts a saving throw against the drug or poison, you can attempt a Medicine check. If your result exceeds the DC of the drug or poison, the character receives a +4 bonus to its saving throw against the drug or poison.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_i4jrly0ugm","path":"Quick Reference#/CF_SEP/Skills","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.db.cH8dDjkLQsFoWNJB"}}}

{"_id":"0VwolXKB37rmUQzm","name":"Combat Maneuvers","content":"<p>As a standard action, you can attempt one of the following combat maneuvers. For each maneuver, choose an opponent within your reach (including your weapon’s reach, if applicable) and then make a melee attack roll against the opponent’s KAC + 8. The effects of success vary depending on the maneuver, as described below.</p>\n<h1>Bull Rush</h1>\n<p>You knock the target back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8. If an obstacle is in the way, the target stops at the obstacle instead.</p>\n<h1>Dirty Trick</h1>\n<p>You make an unorthodox attack to briefly hinder the target. A dirty trick could be throwing sand in the target’s eyes, jamming a rock into his actuators, or any other improvised action designed to put your opponent at a disadvantage. Your target is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{Deafened}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened} (your choice) for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8 (see Conditions beginning on page 273 for information on these conditions). The target can remove the condition as a move action. A dirty trick is normally a melee attack, but a GM can allow certain actions to count as dirty tricks at range, in which case you take a –2 penalty to your attack roll for every 5 feet between you and the target.</p>\n<h1>Disarm</h1>\n<p>You knock an item the target is holding out of the target’s hands and onto the ground. If you have a hand free, you can automatically grab the item with your hand before it falls.</p>\n<h1>Grapple</h1>\n<p>You hold the target in place. You must have at least one hand free to perform a grapple combat maneuver. Your target has the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} condition, meaning she can’t move from her current space and takes further penalties until she either uses a standard action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver to grapple you (giving you the grappled condition) or uses the escape task of the @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.VPGrhncTMiLzpYCH]{Acrobatics} skill to break free. If the result of your attack roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 13, the target is instead @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XgK4EdO5D3Fj3iWz]{Pinned} for the same duration, and she can’t take any actions that involve moving her limbs other than to attempt to escape.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The grappled or pinned condition lasts until the end of your next turn, unless you renew it on your next turn with another grapple combat maneuver. The condition ends immediately if you move away. As long as you have one target grappled or pinned, you cannot attempt to grapple another. The grappled and pinned conditions are further detailed in Conditions on pages 276–277.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When you renew a grapple, you can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed, including most weapons and equipment (but not worn armor). Doing so immediately ends the grapple.</p>\n<h1>Reposition</h1>\n<p>You change the target’s position to a different location still within your reach and within 5 feet of its original placement. You can move the target 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8, but all movement must remain within your reach. You cannot move the target past an obstacle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you reposition a creature as a full action, you can move a distance equal to the distance you repositioned your target (up to your move speed), dragging the target along with you.</p>\n<h1>Sunder</h1>\n<p>You deal damage to one object held in the target’s hand or accessible on its body. The object must be something that could be drawn easily by the target as a move action (see @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.MZQAv36DPh5AuI73]{Draw or Sheathe a Weapon} on page 247). The damage is reduced by an amount equal to the object’s hardness (see Smashing an Object page 409).</p>\n<h1>Trip</h1>\n<p>You knock the target prone if it is on the ground. A target in the air instead descends 10 feet, falling @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} if this causes it to fall to the ground. A target in zero gravity is instead knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.QnGpBSHSTiszjPSb]{Off-Kilter}.

You can attempt a Stealth check to hide either as a move action (if you are planning to stay immobile) or as part of a move action. If you move at a rate of half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Stealth check. If you attempt to hide while moving more than half your speed or after creating a diversion with Bluff, you take a –10 penalty to your Stealth check; these penalties are cumulative if you do both. The check is opposed by the @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.UsPvbP54Igvr1lNy]{Perception} checks of creatures in the area that might detect you. A creature that fails the opposed skill check treats you as if you had total concealment as long as you continue to have actual cover or concealment. A creature that succeeds at the opposed skill check either sees you or pinpoints you (see page 260) in situations when you have total concealment.

{"_id":"3BEhtlUJDABwyq7a","name":"Concealment","content":"<p>Originating from sources such as dense smoke and battlefield position, concealment obscures precise senses and imposes a miss chance on attacks. When you have concealment, it’s harder for enemies to see you clearly. This might be due to your position on the battlefield, or it might be due to another effect that makes it more difficult for enemies to perceive and hit you with an attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To determine whether you have concealment from a creature’s ranged attack, choose a corner of the enemy’s square. If any line from this corner to any corner of your square passes through a square that provides concealment or the border of such a square, you have concealment. Also use these rules when a creature makes a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When a creature is making a melee attack against an adjacent target, the target has concealment if its space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, some effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>\n<h1>Concealment Miss Chance</h1>\n<p>Concealment gives the target of a successful attack a chance that the attacker actually missed. This is called a miss chance. Normally, the miss chance for concealment is 20%. Make the attack normally; if the attacking creature would hit, the target must roll a 20 or lower on a d% roll (see page 513) to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.</p>\n<h1>Varying Degrees Of Concealment</h1>\n<p>Certain situations can provide more or less of a miss chance than typical concealment. In this case, it is up to the GM to determine a character’s degree of concealment.</p>\n<h1>Total Concealment</h1>\n<p>If a creature has line of effect to you but not line of sight (see page 271), you have total concealment. An enemy can’t attack you when you have total concealment, though it can attack into a square it thinks you occupy. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of 20%).</p>\n<h1>Ignoring Concealment</h1>\n<p>Concealment might be ineffective. Dim light or darkness doesn’t provide concealment against creatures with @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.nHhvyUE4TIfZoffm]{Darkvision}. Creatures with low-light vision can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"jrmz8miJxPRH0mLK":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.uDLJtoc4QpsynRus"},"cf":{"id":"temp_rya4a66nfo","path":"Quick Reference","color":"#000000"}}}

However, soft cover provides no bonus to Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to attempt a @Compendium[sfrpg-quick-reference.quick-reference.G3jbDzxaGZT47E95]{Stealth} check.</p>\n<h1>Partial Cover</h1>\n<p>If more than half of you is visible, your bonuses from cover are reduced to +2 to AC and +1 to Reflex saving throws.</p>\n<h1>Improved Cover</h1>\n<p>In some cases, such as when a target is hiding behind a gun port in a defensive wall, cover provides greater bonuses to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal bonuses to AC and Reflex saves are doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively).</p>\n<h1>Total Cover</h1>\n<p>If an enemy doesn’t have line of effect to you (see page 271), you have total cover from the enemy. A creature can’t make an attack against a target that has total cover.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"zqI3t2KnRGKDlExk":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.5zkQrLbmTMGxyEeb"},"cf":{"id":"temp_rya4a66nfo","path":"Quick Reference","color":"#000000"}}}
